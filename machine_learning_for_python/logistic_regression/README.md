# logistic regression model
this model is about perceptron and test on UCI [Horse Colic Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Horse+Colic), we use batch gradient descent(BGD) method to solve and stochastic gradient descent(SGD) to slove. the result we use **BGD** test is : the wrong rate of test data is average **0.284**. the result we use **SGD** test is : the wrong rate of test data is average **0.291**.
