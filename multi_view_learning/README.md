# Multi-view-Learning
===================
My project is about multi-view learning. a great many methods of learning from multi-view data by considering the
diversity of different views have been proposed. So I want to code some of classic algorithm about multi-view learning problem. The list of algorithm is below(to be continued)
## classification

### semi-supervised
1. basic naive bayes
2. basic EM
3. basic co-training
4. co-training EM

### unsupervised
1. co-training kmeans 
2. co-training spectual clustering.
3. co-regularized spectual clustering.

## regression  
1. co-regression
