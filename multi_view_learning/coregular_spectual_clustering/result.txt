DataSset: I use synth3views_2cluster data set. There are 3 views of data, each views has corresponding 1000 samples as well as 2 features. They were classified into 2 class(1,2).

Single view spectual clustering: I only use nmi to examine the clustering accurency, for view 1 the nmi is 0.907, for view 2 the nmi is 0.679 and view 3 is 0.491.

Coregularized pairwise spectual clustering: I iterative 10 iterations. The result nmi of pairwise algorithm is 0.989.

Coregularized centroid spectual clustering: I iterative 10 iterations. The result nmi of centroid algorithm is 0.989.
